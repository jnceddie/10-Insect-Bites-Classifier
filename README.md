 10-Insect-Bites-Classifier

A machine learning web application for classifying insect bites using image analysis and deep learning. This thesis project uses a Flask backend, TensorFlow/Keras models, and visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and OpenCV to provide professional analysis and diagnosis of insect bite images.

Features
- Insect bite image classification using deep learning
- Interactive web interface built with Flask
- Visualization of results and features
- Uses models trained with TensorFlow/Keras
- Image processing with OpenCV and scikit-image
